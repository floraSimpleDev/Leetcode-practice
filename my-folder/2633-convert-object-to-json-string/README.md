## JSON Stringify

Given a value, return a valid JSON string of that value.

The value can be one of the following:

- string
- number
- array
- object
- boolean
- `null`

The returned string should **not include extra spaces**.

The order of keys should be the same as the order returned by `Object.keys()`.

Please solve it **without using the built-in `JSON.stringify` method**.

### Example 1

**Input**

```js
object = {"y":1,"x":2}

Output

{"y":1,"x":2}

Explanation

Return the JSON representation.

Note that the order of keys should be the same as the order returned by Object.keys().

Example 2

Input

object = {"a":"str","b":-12,"c":true,"d":null}

Output

{"a":"str","b":-12,"c":true,"d":null}

Explanation

The primitive JSON types are strings, numbers, booleans, and null.

Example 3

Input

object = {"key":{"a":1,"b":[{},null,"Hello"]}}

Output

{"key":{"a":1,"b":[{},null,"Hello"]}}

Explanation

Objects and arrays can contain other objects and arrays.

Example 4

Input

object = true

Output

true

Explanation

Primitive types are valid inputs.

Constraints

value is a valid JSON value

1 <= JSON.stringify(object).length <= 10^5

maxNestingLevel <= 1000

all strings contain only alphanumeric characters
